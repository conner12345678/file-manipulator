hello there dear freind
I have been meaning to tell you this for quite a while so do sit down and listen
You see despite the fact that as we do work together as a team quite functionally you have to understand that having us work together is a liability
Now do keep your seat, you have yet to finish your coffee! I know what I am suggesting may shound horrid but I feel that there is benifit for the both of us.
You see you are going to go to America for a few months, I have already got your transportation in order. All you have to do is enjoy your life there for around four months.
Now now no need to get upset, as soon as you return we can continue on our little mission, i promise. Its just that the both of us could use a bit of fresh air without worrying eachother over little things.
Again it is just a few months no need to get this worked up! Now if you would preffer not to go that can be arranged and I shall go in your stead, however one of us is staying while the other leaves.
Look the only reason I offered you the leaving spot was because I remembered you had wanted to see other parts of the world, so I thought this would be a great oppertunity!
I am sorry that this has to happen but you dont seem to understand why this has to happen, look last time we both almost died because of each other, so I feel that if we got a bit of time to train alone and came back together after that we could do even better!
Great to know that I have convinced you, I get that it will be a difficult venture but I feel that it will be benificial.ya like jazz????????????
